# Distance measurement with a laser sensor

## Introduction
The goal of the project is to design and implement a built-in application in C language for Wemos D1 R32 w/ ESP32, which will measure the distance of the nearest object from the sensor and display its value (in centimeters) on the display. In addition, the equipment includes a power array, a VL53L0X distance sensor, an OLED display (IIC), an encoder and a set of connecting wires.
