# IMP - Microprocessors and Embedded Systems

# Introduction
In each exercise, a simple task is solved, on which you will always practice some key basic concept of programming embedded systems. We work directly on the hardware (kits with NXP Kinetis microcontrollers with an ARM core).
+ Topics:
    * lab_01 - Communication via UART. Event detection using polling.
    * lab_02 - Application of ports as general purpose digital/digital inputs/outputs (GPIO), detection of an event (button press) using an interrupt, response to an event using an interrupt handler.
    * lab_03 - Pulse width modulation (PWM) using a timer and an application based on it(RGB LED intensity control).
    * lab_04 - Continuous signal sampling using an AD converter, sample processing.
